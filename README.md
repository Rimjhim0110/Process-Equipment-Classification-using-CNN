# Process Equipment Classification using CNN

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 2432 instances of process equipment symbols used in P&IDs. After preprocessing and splitting the dataset, here is a summary of the dataset:

| #Classes | #Train Images | #Validation Images | #Test Images |
| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| 30 | 1728 | 192 | 480 |

### Sample Dataset
Here are sample images of some process equipment symbols present in the dataset:
